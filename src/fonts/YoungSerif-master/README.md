# Young Serif

![Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noirblancrouge/YoungSerif/master/documentation/images/young-serif.jpg)

Young Serif is a heavy weight old style serif typeface, taking inspiration from Plantin Infant or ITC Italian Old Style. 
The lowercase b and f feature rounded curves, adding a tender and generous quality to this font.
